## Citation

Asimov, I. (1950). *I, Robot*. Gnome Press.  

*“A robot cannot harm a human being, nor allow a human to come to harm through inaction.”*  

### The Three Laws of Robotics
1. Protecting humans from harm.  
2. Following human instructions.  
3. Preserving their own existence — as long as it doesn’t conflict with the first two principles.

This module is the **Machine Learning stage** of our **Data Science Bootcamp**.  
It introduces the theory, implementation, and case studies of classical ML algorithms, blending mathematics with hands-on coding.

##  Learning Outcomes
By completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the intuition and mathematics behind core ML algorithms.  
- Implement algorithms **from scratch** and with **scikit-learn**.  
- Apply ML methods to **real-world datasets** and evaluate their performance.  
- Build confidence in moving towards **deep learning** and **AI applications**.  

---

##  Structure

- **Course Theory** → PDF chapters with mathematical foundations.  
- **Algorithm Implementations** → Jupyter notebooks implementing models step by step.  
- **Case Studies** → Real datasets to practice supervised and unsupervised learning.  

All detailed content is already included inside the Jupyter notebooks and PDFs.  
This README serves as an overview and quick start guide.
